I used to think that the most hardcore engineers had blogs that were mostly text, with the content being the main focus. Just look at the [personal site](https://www.stroustrup.com/) of Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, and you'll see what I mean.

I think I yearned for a reality in which "real" engineers were flying by the
seat of their pants, programming with a magnetized needle and a steady hand. As
I've matured as an engineer I've realized that usability and human-centered
design are just as important as raw engineering prowess. So this is my attempt
at keeping a cleaner personal site.
