representation would be really nice. I wrote a pretty quick and dirty script in
pygame to do this. You can click on dead cells to make them come alive and
click on live ones to kill them. You can also pause the game by hitting any key
during play. This thing is very much still under development. One known bug is
that when you first pause and click on the board, the game will move forward
one iteration. It will not move again until unpaused. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some
simple flow control issue I&#39;m not seeing (post in the comments if you have any
suggestions). This uses my previous gameoflifeclasses script from the previous
post. You should save that script as a .py file, then save this script as a .py
file in the same directory.</p>
<p><img src="../images/conwayPyGame/initial.jpg" alt="initial" title="Initial image"> This is what you&#39;ll likely see when you start up the script:
The default starting configuration is a glider. You can change this by changing
lines under the #hardcoded comment in the <strong>init</strong> constructor of the GOL
class.</p>
<p>Please do whatever you want with the code, just give me credit when you do.
Also please point out bugs.</p>
<p>Possible new features: </p>
<ul>
<li>A memory system so that you can scroll through previous iterations of the game board</li>
<li>A slider control for how fast the game updates</li>
<li>A (semi) infinite board where you can zoom into or out of different regions (and that gets smaller as more of the board is explored by cells.</li>
</ul>
