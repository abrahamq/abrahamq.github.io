The game was created by British mathematician John Conway as a simple way to
simulate life. The playing field is a grid of squares, where each square either
holds a live cell or a dead one. The basic rules (taken from the wiki article)
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want more information about the game itself and its significance, I&#39;ll be
posting another blog on the topic soon.  I started this project by writing a
quick python script that could output the game of life board as a nicely
formatted array of 1s (living cells) and 0s (dead cells). After that, I turned
the script into a class and made it possible to create Game of Life objects and
to do lots more stuff with it. Here&#39;s the current version of the script:  The
main function that is included will create a GOL object that is 10 cells by 10
cells. It will then add points at (0,0) and (1,1). Note: the grid works like
pixels on the screen, it starts at (0,0) at the top left of the board. The
script will output a 10 by 10 grid to the console.You are welcome to make any
modifications and share the code as you wish, just give me credit.</p>
