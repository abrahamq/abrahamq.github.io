&quot;Uncomplicated FireWall&quot;. Here are the commands I ran to get ufw set up: </p>
<p>sudo pacman -Sy ufw 
sudo ufw allow SSH    - so my current ssh connection doesn&#39;t get cut off :) 
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp - allow net trafic to hit the machine </p>
<p>sudo ufw enable 
sudo systemctl enable ufw -set to run at boot </p>
<p>--- and that&#39;s the end of ufw configuration</p>
<p>Next up I installed nginx: </p>
<p>sudo pacman -Sy nginx 
sudo systemctl enable nginx.service</p>
<p>--- I already had node installed so I didn&#39;t have to do anything about that, but you 
might have to make sure that node is installed and up to date. </p>
<p>next up, I configured nginx. The node app is listening on port 8080, so we have to tell 
nginx to forward port 80 traffic to 8080. </p>
<p>do: sudo vim /etc/nginx/ngnix.conf</p>
<p>and now we&#39;re going to modify one of the server blocks to point to our own location: Here&#39;s what 
my server blocks look like for this server, which has a domain of abrahamq.mit.edu</p>
<pre><code>server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  abrahamq.mit.edu;

    #charset koi8-r;

    #access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
} </code></pre><p>next up, I installed pm2, a process manager for node. It will make sure that node gets restarted if it 
if the app crashes. </p>
<p>npm install -g pm2</p>
<p>Now I pulled in the node project with git and did: </p>
<p>pm2 start &lt;app.js&gt; (in reality I have a process.json that describes some more stuff that I want pm2 to do). </p>
<p>Now you should be able to see the app at your domain. </p><footer><nav><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/resume.html">Resume</a><a href="/todo.html">Todo</a><a href="https://github.com/abrahamq?tab=repositories">Github</a></nav></footer></body></html>
