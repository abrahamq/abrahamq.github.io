I went into the BIOS and changed the
setting, then exited saving changes. It gets a bit fuzzy after that. The laptop
turned off and didn&#39;t come back up- just a black screen whenever I turned it on
or tried to go into the BIOS through the side button. I looked at it wondering
if I&#39;d just bricked my laptop.</p>
<p>I unscrewed the bottom (warranty seal was already broken from the hard drive
replacement earlier) and then disconnected the laptop&#39;s battery and the small
watch battery as well for about 20 seconds. Then I connected both and tried to
boot again- same symptoms- just a black screen on both normal boot and booting
into the BIOS. Next, I shut it down and disconnected just the watch battery,
leaving only the laptop battery connected. Now it booted and everything worked
fine. I think that it was this last step that got rid of the bad stuff in the
CMOS- just disconnect the battery and try to boot with it disconnected.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I once again tried to switch the video card option from just the
Intel VGA graphics (which I had enabled to save battery life) into using the
NVidia Optimus technology. This time it worked.</p>
<p>I might write another post about getting Optimus working with 
bumblebee on Ubuntu 12.04. Last time I tried this I bricked my computer, so wish me luck.</p><footer><nav><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/about">About</a><a href="/resume">Resume</a><a href="/todo">Todo</a></nav></footer></body></html>
